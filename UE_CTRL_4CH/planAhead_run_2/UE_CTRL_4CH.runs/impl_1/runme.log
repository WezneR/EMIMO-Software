WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found

   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.
