  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   3
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1108 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <PLUG_IN> is placed at site <T13>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <PLUG_IN_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y5>. There is only
   a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and
   they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you
   may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote this
   message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is
   listed below. These examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to
   override this clock rule.
   < NET "PLUG_IN" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >

ERROR:Place:1108 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <SPI_CLK> is placed at site <H16>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <SPI_CLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y6>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists

ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings

-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network TXD_MCU_IBUF has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 12 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   MODE_IBUF,
   SPI_CLK_MCU_IBUF,
   UPDATE_IBUF,
   SPI_LE_MCU_IBUF,
   REV2_MCU_IBUF
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.260 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).
